## Objectives

- [ ] Implement a version from the game Breakout.
- [ ] Add a powerup to the game that spawns two extra Balls.
- [ ] Grow and shrink the Paddle when the player gains enough points or loses a life.
- [ ] Add a locked Brick that will only open when the player collects a second new powerup, a key, which should only spawn when such a Brick exists and randomly as per the Ball powerup.
